# "Privés de savoir? " - _addendum 1_ : French Law
The Law for a Digital Republic promulgated on 8 October 2016 includes an article dedicated to open access to scientific articles, article 30.

# "Privés de savoir? " - _addendum 1_ : French Law

In short, all scientific **articles** resulting from public research can now be deposited into an open access repository :
* in a manuscript format : **author accepted  manuscript** (AAM),
* with a maximum **embargo** of 6 months (science and medicine)/12 months (humanities and social sciences),

regardless of the publisher's open access policy.

## Do you want to know more?

* [Read article 30 of the law on Legifrance](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/eli/loi/2016/10/7/ECFI1524250L/jo#JORFARTI000033202841)

A dedicated website : http://whoneedsaccess.org

> This site is run collaboratively by the [@access working group](http://access.okfn.org/) — a loose coalition of academics in various fields — plus you.  We want to know your stories about how access to scientific literature has enabled you to do more, create more, and give more back to the world.  If that’s you, please see the [Contribute](https://whoneedsaccess.org/contribute/) page.

#  "Privés de savoir? " - _addendum 3_ : what does access means?

>  By "open access" to this literature, we mean its free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited.

# The gold : specificity for humanities and social sciences


In contrast with journals in exact sciences, technology and medicine, most open acess journals in social sciences and humanities do not charge fees (_article processing charges_).
The economic model of those journals may be based on one or more of the following elements.
* **Sponsor** funding : publications costs are covered through donations, grants, institutional subsidies, etc.
* **Embargo** period : articles are automatically made open access after a defined period of time - see [journals with Embargo period policy published by OpenEdition](https://www.openedition.org/catalogue-journals?limit=30&access%5B%5D=Barri%C3%A8re+mobile)
* **Freemium** : extra services are charged to (partially) cover publication costs - see [journals with Open access Freemium published by OpenEdition](https://www.openedition.org/catalogue-journals?limit=30&access%5B%5D=Open+access+Freemium)

# You are producing publications : publishing preprints?

> In short, a preprint is a research output that has not completed a typical publication pipeline but is of value to the community and deserving of being easily discovered and accessed.

# You are producing publications : publishing preprints?

Does this way of publishing apply to humanities and social sciences (beyond economy that has long adopted it)? 

> In the short run, SocArXiv will be a convenient, fast, free, open paper server. In the longer run, we hope it will be a building block for the future system of scholarly communication. In sociology, the discipline with which I (and our steering committee) are most familiar, we do not have a strong cultural norm of pre-print paper sharing, or data sharing. But sociologists – like most social scientists – do want our research to have an impact in the wider world, to reach a broader audience, and to engage with the public for the benefit of all parties. Our challenge is to persuade these academic communities that open scholarship is necessary for achieving that larger ambition.

# You are producing research : "open access made concrete"

>* You can show how your research **evolves over time** (with everything being online, you are held accountable if you change your  mind, say things differently, etc.)
>* You can **address different communities** depending on what part of your research you decide to make available
>* You have tools to speak about your data/corpora in further publications

First level items, see slides 8 and 9 for details
