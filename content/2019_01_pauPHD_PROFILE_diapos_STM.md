# Agenda
## Game of the 7 families - actually 4

![all_numbers](img/allnumbers.jpg)

## Discussions : :question:Q01 :question:Q02

---

# Agenda
## Introduction : definition, issues
## Family 1 : academic social networks
## Family 2 : publishers' identifiers
## Family 3 : persistent identifiers
## Family 4 : open access repositories
## What opportunities for you?

#  Introduction : researcher profile?

Two main components are obvious.

## A web page
* Can you create a CV?
* Can you add free text?
* Can you add rich text (with images, hyperlinks, etc.)? 


## A publication list
* Are the metadata comprehensive and accurate?
* Is the list updated automatically or manually?
* How is access to full-text handled?


---

# Introduction : issues 1/2
## Identity
Make sure to be identified
* as yourself
* as a researcher

## Visibility / accessibility
Make sure to make visible / and accessible
* your publications
* your other outputs
* your other academic activities

---
# Introduction : issues 2/2


## Save time
:alarm_clock: Will you be willing to spend time updating different sites and services? Is it possible to find services with automatic updates? And services connectable to others to maximize automation?

## Impact / metrics
We will not discuss this topic today.

---

# Issues : identity

## Background
* more and more researchers
* a few names

## Names ambiguity
* Homonymy
* Different versions: full first name/initial(s)
* Transliteration
* Accents and other special characters
* Change of name
* Multiple names
:point_right: Names are not **machine readable**


---

# Issues : visibility / accessibility

## Background
* Dispersion of resources and access modes
* More and more research organizations are unsubscribing from subscription resources (or have never been able to subscribe due to costs)
* See part 1 about open access : provide access to users outside research organizations

# Introduction : researcher profile?

Here are the criteria of analysis and choice we are going to apply to the 4 families.

**1. Identification**
Does the tool identify you and how? Does it provide a reliable identification? 
**2. Web page**
Does the tool allow you to create a webpage? To what extent is it customizable?
**3. Publication list**
How does the tool perform regarding creating and updating your publication list?
**4. Full-text access**
Does the tool give access to your publications?
**5. Interoperability / openness**
Can you export your data? Can you connect your profile with other services, platforms, etc.?
**6. Compliance**
Does the tool allow you to be compliant with stakeholders' requirements?

# Before starting the game of 4 families, what families do you already use?

# Family 1 : academic social networks

# Family 1 : academic social networks : overview

Figures retrieved in April 2017 : 55 millions of accounts for [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net), 13 millions for [Academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/)

# Family 1 : academic social networks : what for?

# Family 1 : academic social networks : criteria 1/2

### 1. Identification
:warning::one: Very weak : no identifier provided and questionable accuracy of suggestions

### 2. Web page
Very limited customization

### 3. Publication list
Easy to create and update, but accuracy and quality of metadata are far from being guaranteed and customization is very limited

---
# Family 1 : academic social networks : criteria 2/2

### 4. Full-text access
:warning::two: Permissions might be different from the ones granted to deposit into an open access repository - see [Elsevier's sharing policy](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/sharing) and remember the wording of Law for a Digital Republic
:heavy_plus_sign: open access is not guaranteed

### 5. Interoperability / openness
You can put a lot of stuff into this kind of service, :warning::three: but what can you export?
### 6. Compliance
No way - see 4. - on the contrary, be aware of what content you upload if the servers' location is unknown

# Family 1 : academic social networks : warnings
:warning::one: Weak identification resulting in unrelevant authorship suggestions

# Family 1 : academic social networks : warnings
:warning::three: Closed systems and economic concerns

> There is a big chance that as in the past commercial publishers have been selling our own _content_, our articles and books, back to us, or to our libraries, increasingly these kinds of platforms will be selling our own _data_ back to us or, more likely, to our universities, to feed into impact case studies and tenure portfolios. The data which is based on the relationships we have built up with others around ourselves and around our publications.

Yet a positive and real use of ResearchGate and co?

> It was pointed out to me (on twitter) that ResearchGate can be important for scholars in China which has an authoritarian government that cuts off access to not just Facebook, but also Google**.

# Family 2 : publishers' identifiers

![number one](img/number_2.jpg)

# Family 2 : overview

## Objectives for publishers 
* Ensure the reliability of their bibliographic database
* Address the issue of ambiguity of names

## Specific features 
* Integration with bibliographic databases 
* Bibliometric indicators - limited to articles indexed in the database of reference

:point_right: **ResearcherID** : created in 2008 - Clarivate Analytics = Web of Science
:point_right: **Scopus Author ID** : created in 2006 - Elsevier = Scopus

# Family 2 : overview

|ResearcherID|Scopus AuthorID|
|:--| :--|
|created by the user|automatically and systematically created by Elsevier|
|independant from a subscription to Web of Science for basic features| cannot be changed or edited without subscription to Scopus|
|possible to add publications from other sources | limited to publications indexed in Scopus : cannot attach publications from other sources |
