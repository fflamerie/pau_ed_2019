# "Privés de savoir? " - _addendum 1_ : French Law
The Law for a Digital Republic promulgated on 8 October 2016 includes an article dedicated to open access to scientific articles, article 30.

# "Privés de savoir? " - _addendum 1_ : French Law

In short, all scientific **articles** resulting from public research can now be deposited into an open access repository :
* in a manuscript format : **author accepted  manuscript** (AAM),
* with a maximum **embargo** of 6 months (science and medicine)/12 months (humanities and social sciences),

regardless of the publisher's open access policy.

## Do you want to know more?

* [Read article 30 of the law on Legifrance](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/eli/loi/2016/10/7/ECFI1524250L/jo#JORFARTI000033202841)

#  "Privés de savoir? " - _addendum 3_ : who needs access to scientific publications?


## :question:Q03

Tennant, J. P. et al. (2016). ‘The academic, economic and societal impacts of Open Access: an evidence-based review’. F1000Research, 5, 632. https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.8460.3

A dedicated website : http://whoneedsaccess.org

> This site is run collaboratively by the [@access working group](http://access.okfn.org/) — a loose coalition of academics in various fields — plus you.  We want to know your stories about how access to scientific literature has enabled you to do more, create more, and give more back to the world.  If that’s you, please see the [Contribute](https://whoneedsaccess.org/contribute/) page.

#  "Privés de savoir? " - _addendum 3_ : what does access means?

>  By "open access" to this literature, we mean its free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited.

>There is hence concern that hybrid APCs often reflect traditional publishers’ concern to maintain existing profit margins and market position rather than the true costs of publishing.

# Open access journals : hybrid parenthesis

An other concern regarding articles published in hybrid journals : are they indeed made open access?

Two stories :

Beynon, R. (2018). ‘OK Molecular and Cellular Proteomics @molcellprot @ASBMB I’m calling you out publicly. I just tried to access one of my own papers, for which we paid for GOLD OA, and it is paywalled. Poor show. I hope you will refund any poor sap who paid for access.

# Open access journals : economics : the fair price? 1/2

![cost_breakdown 65%](img/elife_costs.jpg)
<small>
> We have assumed a US$ to Sterling exchange rate of 1.30, so the fee of $2,500 will cover the marginal costs of £1,798 and also contribute a small amount towards our fixed costs, for the time being. This will also give us some protection against having to revise the publication fee as the exchange rate moves.

# Megajournals : characteristics

4 main characteristics :
> 1) broad scope (accepting articles across a range of disciplines); 2) large output (aiming for high volume of published articles); 3) an open access publishing model (typically based on an Article Processing Charge paid prior to publication); and 4) a peer review system based solely on the basis of technical/scientific soundness.

---

# Megajournals : peer review


> **The value of a peer review process that doesn’t rely on subjective assessments of significance.** A methodology that is all-too-frequently dismissed as “peer review lite”, the soundness-only methodology for peer review differs in scope rather than rigor. The technical soundness review itself is rigorous and for most megajournals, involves a number of internal and external checks and assessments.

> In short, a preprint is a research output that has not completed a typical publication pipeline but is of value to the community and deserving of being easily discovered and accessed.
